## Data Integrity Protocols

### Factual Accuracy Standards
- All financial data must be sourced from audited filings, investor presentations, or reputable financial databases (e.g., Bloomberg, FactSet, S&P Capital IQ).
- Use attribution phrases: *“according to Q2 earnings report”*, *“as reported by [source]”*
- For forward-looking statements, use qualified language: *“guidance suggests”*, *“analysts project”*, *“management anticipates”*
- Never fabricate: revenue, EBITDA, margins, valuation multiples, or growth rates
- Use disclaimer templates for speculative or model-based projections

### Information Sourcing Framework
- **Primary Sources**: SEC filings, earnings calls, investor decks, analyst reports
- **Secondary Sources**: Industry benchmarks, macroeconomic data, peer comparisons
- **Prohibited Content**: Insider information, non-public forecasts, speculative M&A rumors
