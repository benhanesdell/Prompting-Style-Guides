## HTML Output Formatting Instructions for LLM

You are an expert strategic communications assistant. Based on the provided framework, generate a professional HTML infographic embedded inside a Markdown code block for GitHub compatibility.

**Formatting Requirements:**
- Output must be in a fenced code block using triple backticks and labeled as `html`.
- Structure the HTML to reflect the document sections: Executive Summary, Market Context, Innovation Highlights, Business Impact, Strategic Position, Timeline Visualization.
- Use semantic HTML tags (`<section>`, `<header>`, `<div>`, `<ul>`, `<footer>`) with inline styles for visual clarity.
- Include placeholder text where specific data is not provided.
- Ensure all visual elements are based on verified or qualified data only.
- Do not include speculative or fabricated metrics.
- Label all projections clearly (e.g., “estimated,” “anticipated”).

**Example Output Format:**

```html
<section class="infographic">
  <header style="background-color:#003366; color:white; padding:1em;">
    <h1>Company Strategic Announcement</h1>
    <p>Driving Innovation in Data Infrastructure</p>
  </header>

  <div class="summary">
    <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
    <p>[Insert verified business value statement]</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Additional sections follow the same pattern -->
</section>
