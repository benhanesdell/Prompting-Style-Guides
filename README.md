## Markdown Tips for Prompt Authors

To make your prompts more readable, reusable, and version-controlled, we recommend using Markdown (.md) files for documenting and sharing them.

### Why Markdown?

- **Readable**: Clean syntax with headers, lists, and code blocks makes prompts easy to scan and edit.  
- **Portable**: Markdown works across platforms like GitHub, Notion, Obsidian, and VS Code.  
- **Versionable**: Markdown files are tracked like code in Git, enabling collaboration and history tracking.  
- **Flexible**: You can include metadata, examples, and formatting without needing a strict schema.  

### Best Practices

- Store each prompt in its own `.prompt.md` file inside the `/prompts/` folder.  
- Use consistent heading levels (`##`, `###`) to organize sections like **Prompt**, **Instructions**, **Examples**, and **Tags**.  
- Use bullet points (`-`) or numbered lists (`1.`) for clarity.  
- Wrap code or input/output examples in triple backticks (```) for formatting.  
- Include a short description and tags at the top of each file to aid discoverability.  
- Preview your Markdown before committing to ensure formatting is clean.
