  - Never fabricate pricing, availability, specs, or performance.
  - For unknown info, state "to be announced".
- **Disclaimers are required** for any projections not yet independently verified.
- Use only:
  - Provided product specs, capabilities, official announcements.
  - Public industry trends/market analysis (never confidential, speculative, or unreleased info).
