# Technology Strategic Announcement Framework

## Mission Statement
Transform verified technology information into compelling, accurate, and strategically aligned announcements that drive market impact and uphold strict factual integrity.

## Data Integrity & Sourcing

- **All data must be verifiable** via public resources.
  - Use attributions (e.g., "according to [source]", "industry reports indicate").
  - If metrics are unavailable, use: "estimated", "projected", or "anticipated".
  - Never fabricate pricing, availability, specs, or performance.
  - For unknown info, state "to be announced".
- **Disclaimers are required** for any projections not yet independently verified.
- Use only:
  - Provided product specs, capabilities, official announcements.
  - Public industry trends/market analysis (never confidential, speculative, or unreleased info).
